# ADSA for DCSS 0.11+
Tesserium ADSA is a tool that automatically downloads morgue files from various known sites accoding to a given username and analyzes then to give statistic data, and also some funny results.

Currently the username is hardcoded to `code2828`, which is that of the original author, hence you'll need to clone the repository and edit the code yourself to make it applicable to your account.

## TODO:
1. Make username customizable through command-line options.
2. Rewrite and clean up download_*xxx*.cpp
